# Project 4 - Thesis Project Proposal:
## Name:
nikode (or something else): beginning programmer journey and resources app


## MVP:
CRUD resource app that users can view and benefit from and Admins can add, update, and delete posts 
What your reach goals are.

## Reach Goals
using react for my front end and possibly bootstrap for styling

## User stories: 
1. As an Admin Nikoder, I'm often asked for advice on how to get started programming, apply to bootcamps, or more information about resources I've benefited from. I'd like to be able to vist the application, sign in, and be able to add, update, and delete blog posts  and also resources that are being displayed so I can refer early stage nikoders to this application when asked.

2. As a User Nikoder, I would like to without logging-in have access to the reading blog posts and info resources on the application to further my coding journey.

## Foreseen challenges or obstacles
1.I'm still shaky on ruby on rails and correcting the mistakes I'm sure to make will keep my busy.
2.The auth needed to make an admin version of the app and the additional views and logic that will require
3. Also I'd like this despite being a simple idea to be visually impressive, so I'm aiming to push my styling to the next level once MVP is made.
